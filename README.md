# ****Spaceship Titanic****
This dataset contains information on passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic, a fictional interstellar vessel on a mission to colonize a distant planet. The dataset includes demographic, ticket, and cabin information, as well as information on passenger survival.

# **Problem Statement**
In this scenario, the Spaceship Titanic encounters a catastrophic event that causes it to crash land on an unknown planet. As an analyst, your task is to use data analysis techniques to identify the factors that affected survival rates among the passengers. By examining passenger demographics, ticket information, and cabin locations, we can identify patterns that may have influenced survival rates. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived or not based on their features.

# **Goals**
The goal of this dataset is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not based on their features. This model could be used to provide insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and inform future disaster preparedness efforts.

# **Contents**
The dataset is provided in a CSV file format and includes the following columns:

PassengerId: unique identifier for each passenger
HomePlanet: planet of origin for the passenger
CryoSleep: whether the passenger was in cryosleep at the time of the incident
Cabin: cabin number
Destination: intended destination for the passenger
Age: passenger's age
VIP: whether the passenger was a VIP
RoomService: whether the passenger had access to room service
FoodCourt: whether the passenger had access to a food court
ShoppingMall: whether the passenger had access to a shopping mall
Spa: whether the passenger had access to a spa
VRDeck: whether the passenger had access to a virtual reality deck
Name: passenger's name
Survived: whether the passenger survived or not (1 = yes, 0 = no)
